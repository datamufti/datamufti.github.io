# Data Science, Training, & Other Musings

## Blurb
I'm Talal - a people-oriented many-hat-wearing Data Science Manager. I love building teams and products that solve real problems from first principles, and the inevitable growth that comes with it. Data Science is so broad that a growth mindset seems to be the only way to cope with the ever-expanding domain and skillsets. One could adopt a Beginner's Mindset, but excess humility has its downsides - leading me instead to the Intermediate's Mindset.   

## Why Lifetime Intermediate?
In online lifting culture, there is an archetype of someone who has trained for a very long time and yet never gets past the intermediate level. This can be attributed both to the reality that achieving more advanced results requires increasingly more effort/programming/time, as well as the skewed perceptions brought about by social. While the LTI may be considered an insult to some, I embrace it while I continue the noble pursuit of skill, strength, and self-mastery.
